AboutMy_Self ü§î
Hello
I‚Äôm Muhammad
A machine learning engineer 
Summary
A Machine Learning Engineer skilled in  applying machine learning models on real life problems. Consistently working on improving my set of skills with some market working practice Curious to learn new concepts along with their implementation 


üßê About my time in university
I started learning practical skills from the first year of my bachelors on my own, At university, I loved the core CS courses and also implemented their basics concepts i.e OOP, Data structures, Database Management Systems,theory of computer science Networking, Algorithm design and scored above 3 GPA in all of them (Although I hardly passed other courses). My helloworld was in C#, Moving on I learned Java, C++, C ,javascript, python during the 3 years. My university projects from beginner level to FYP includes

Grocery Store(java),
Banking Management System (Java,OOP),
notepad creation and intgration with OS (windowsForm),
An Inventory Management System (Java, JDBC, Mysql, JavaFX),
String Commpressor(JS),
DFA(Java),
MvcMovie(C#,Mysql,JS,HTML,CSS),
RateListWebApp(C#,Mysql,JS,HTML,CSS,DEVEXPRESS),
ReactApp(REACTJS),
DrawApi(turtle graphics)3D scenes,animation using tree js,
Frontend Compiler (Compiler Construction),
SingleServerQue(modling),
subneting,topologies (networking)
Accounting Cycle (Financial accounting)
Class imbalance problem,Anomaly detection (Fraud detection)
Correlation and  Regression analysis (Gdp growth forecast using advance economic indicators)
